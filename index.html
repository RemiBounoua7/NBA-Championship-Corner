        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The NBA is a very competitive industry in which 30 teams give their all out on the court all year, with only one champion.
            At the start of each season, every team has a different objective, depending on their roster's strength. But how many can realistically target the Larry O'Brien trophy ?
            <br>    <br>   
            We'll try and define a threshold beyong which teams have little to no chance of winning the title, based on previous NBA seasons, 1997 and onwards.
            Is it always the best regular season team that wins it all ? How 'bad' can you be and still have hope based on what happened in the past ?
            Also, what does it say about this year's teams ? Who are the *real* contenders ?
            <br><br>
            That's what we are trying to find out. You'll see, it's gonna be fun.

        <section id="Normalization">
        <h2>Choosing measures and normalization process </h2>
        
        <p >
            To determine the strength of NBA teams during the regular season, we will take Offensive and Defensive ratings. Those are simple measures encapsulating how good/bad teams are on offense and defense, pretty straightforward.
            However, for year to year comparison stakes, we have to normalize our data, so here's a little explanation on the process and why we do it. 
            <br>If you are already familiar with the concept, feel free to skip to the next section.
        </p>
        <p>
            Offensive (Defensive) Ratings measure how much points a team scores (concedes) per 100 possessions.<br>
            What we want to get out of this is the relative strengths of teams, not the absolute number. It doesn't help you to know that the 1997 Bulls had a 112.4 O_RTG,
            you want to know whether it was good or not in 1997 ! What matters is this number in relation to every other teams' rating.<br><br>
            You might also be familiar with the fact that offensive ratings have skyrocketted in the last decade, due to multiple factors including but not limited to the 3P revolution.
            This fact alone prevents us from comparing eras on ratings, because a good defense in the 2020's would look like the worst defense in the 1990's numberwise.<br><br>
            
            That's where our normalization process comes in, to solve both problems at once.
            We want to transform all those ratings into a value, that helps us see which team was a good offense/defense in it's time.
            What we do is we take the year's ratings for all teams, and make them fit into a O-1 range. The best offense will get a 1, the worst will get 0. Same for defense.
            <br><br>
            That way we can compare teams between eras on their relative dominance, and not raw numbers. 

        </p>

        <p>
            There you have the 2024-25 teams ranked based on these principles. You can observe everything we talk about : how OKC is the best defense and NY the best offense.
            How bad are the Wizards and the Pelicans relative to everyone else. <br><br>The exact numbers aren't that important, it's the position in the graph and the relative gap between teams that matter.
            And just like we hypothesized, the best team are in the top right quadrant, with good defense and offense. Yet no team seam to be the overwhelmming favorite.

    <section id="Where are the NBA Champions">
        <h2>The NBA Champions corner</h2>
        <p>
            The basic hypothesis we can make after mapping teams on these axes, is that the better teams are located in the top right corner,
            beeing both good offenses and good defenses. But how good ?<br>Is it possible for a 10th defense and 10th offense to be champion ? 
            Where is the arbitrary line we draw, above which a team is a title contender ?

            <br>
            To answer this question, the best we can do is look back.
            Below is every team ranked on offensive and defensive ratings, for each year from 1997 to 2024.<br>
            The NBA Champions are highlighted by red Arrows, every other team is a blue dot.

        <p><br>    
            What we see is a confirmation of our hypothesis : there is a clear line below which there has never been a championship team !<br><br>
            Besides 2004 Pistons and 2001 Lakers (we'll go back to them in a bit), every champion is above .545 N_DRTG and .529 N_ORTG.<br>
            <br><br>We'll use that as a threshold. From now on, every team inside this corner will be labeled contender, we shall see what comes out of it. If we look at the seasons outcome through this lens, what can we learn ?

        <p >Here are my takeways, feel free to share yours : <br><br>
            - 2001 Lakers and 2004 Pistons are real outliers ! 2004 had NO CONTENDERS and 2001 Kings were robbed (This filter adds even more fuel to this fire)<br>
            - 2007 WARRIORS ! WE BELIEVE !<br>
            - 2011 Mavs really were an underdog, they could've won before but did it past their prime<br>
            - 2013 and 2014 Thunder ... What could've been<br>
            - 2017 Warriors (Durant) were even more dominant than 2016 Warriors (73-9)<br>
            - 2018 Rockets were so close<br>
            - 2021 Jazz was the most dominant regular season team not to win it all<br>
            - 2022 and 2023 were real toss-ups, but 2024 was a total annihilation<br>
            - Overall Western Conferance supremacy<br>

            <br>7 contenders : Boston Cleveland and OKC leading the charge, Memphis, Dallas, Houston and Golden State waiting to pounce.     
            <br><br>
            Is it consistent with what your instinct tells you ? Would you add any team in that mix ? Maybe narrow down the Contender zone ?<br>
            Is it too early to tell ? What team can climb back ? Do you believe in the Bucks or the Knicks ? How about healthy 76ers ? Will the Rockets crash ?<br><br>
            Stay tuned for more vizualisations like that, hope you had a good read !
